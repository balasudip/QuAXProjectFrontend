      <td>What is “Operation Warp Speed” and how were vaccines developed so quickly?</td>
      <td>The federal government, through Operation Warp Speed (OWS), has been working since the start of the pandemic to make a COVID-19 vaccine available. This accelerated timeline has raised concerns for some that safety may be sacrificed in favor of speed. However, safety remains a top priority.\nTo accelerate vaccine development while maintaining standards for safety and efficacy, OWS has selected the most promising vaccine candidates and is providing coordinated government support. Rather than eliminating steps from traditional development timelines, steps have proceeded simultaneously, such as starting manufacturing of the vaccine at industrial scale well before the demonstration of vaccine efficacy and safety as happens normally. This increases the financial risk, but not the risk of the vaccines.</td>

      <td>How do I report a problem or possible side effect to a COVID-19 vaccine?</td>
      <td>The CDC and FDA encourage the public to report possible side effects (called adverse events) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). This national system collects these data to look for adverse events that are unexpected, appear to happen more often than expected, or have unusual patterns of occurrence. Reports to VAERS help the CDC monitor the safety of vaccines. Health care professionals will be required to report certain adverse events following vaccination to VAERS.\n</td>

But you can still get the second dose later if you have difficulty getting it within the recommended time. Just don’t get it earlier than recommended.\nAccording to CDC, if you need help scheduling your vaccine appointment for your second shot, contact the location that set up your appointment for assistance.

Live attenuated viral vaccines, such as measles vaccine, induce an immune response that is similar to natural infection. mRNA vaccines, on the other hand, simply give the body instructions to produce one very specific part of a virus – in this case the so-called spike protein – to then induce an immune response. Because mRNA is broken down very quickly in the human body, to do its work it needs to be able to get into our cells, and so it is wrapped in a lipid nanoparticle. Once it gets into the cells to deliver the instructions, the mRNA breaks down very quickly. It does not get into the nucleus of the cell, or into our genes. Since the new mRNA vaccines have been administered, their safety profiles are reassuring.</td>

A small number of vaccine recipients have experienced anaphylaxis following receipt of the Pfizer vaccine, so all patients should be monitored for at least 15 minutes following COVID-19 vaccine administration. Patients with a history of severe allergic reaction (due to any cause) should be monitored for at least 30 minutes following administration.

Since there are also cases of MIS-A, in young adults, if MIS were to be a problem, we may see it in the larger adult trials. We have not, to date.

These recommended intervals, with a standard four-day grace period, should be followed as closely as possible to receive full protection. If the intervals are exceeded, the second dose should be scheduled for administration up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose, regardless of manufacturer. If the second dose is administered beyond these intervals, there is no need to restart the series, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance. There is a vaccine in development and Phase 3 clinical trials that uses one dose.</td>

      <td>Q. Which COVID-19 vaccine should I take?</td>
      <td>A. Any COVID-19 vaccine authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to be effective. Data available at this point would suggest that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are very similar in their abilities to produce immunity to the virus; the Johnson &amp; Johnson Janssen vaccine was nearly 75% effective. The recommendation would be to take whatever vaccine is made available to you. Be sure to receive the booster shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines at the appropriate time. If you choose not to get a second dose, you may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine. The Johnson &amp; Johnson Janssen vaccine only requires a single dose.</td>

      <td>A. CDC is structuring shipments in such a way that 21 or 28 days after the first shipment, the same number of doses will be shipped, so providers will have enough vaccine for a second dose. The 21- or 28-day requirement between doses is a minimum requirement, not a maximum. If, for some reason, you are unable to receive the second dose at the recommended interval, you can receive the second dose at a later date.</td>

      <td>A. Yes, people who have already had COVID-19 should plan to take the COVID-19 vaccine, because the science is currently inconclusive as to whether you will be naturally protected from a second COVID-19 infection in the future. The CDC currently suggests that if you were infected with COVID-19 during the previous 90 days, it is likely that you still have immune protection and that you will be asked to wait to receive your vaccine to allow others to be vaccinated first.</td>

      <td>Q. Is a COVID-19 vaccine safe?</td>
      <td>A. The U.S. vaccine safety system is a deliberate and multi-phase process to ensure all vaccines are as safe as possible. Safety is a top priority. Vaccine candidates conduct clinical trials with many thousands of study participants to generate scientific data and other information for the FDA to determine their safety and effectiveness.\nIf the FDA determines a vaccine meets its safety and effectiveness standards, it can make these vaccines available for use in the U.S. by approval or Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). After the FDA makes its determination, ACIP will review the available data in order to make vaccine recommendations to the CDC. ACIP will then recommend vaccine use. After a vaccine is authorized or approved for use, vaccine safety monitoring systems will watch for adverse events (possible side effects). CDC is working to expand safety surveillance through new systems and additional information sources, as well as enhancing existing safety monitoring systems.</td>

      <td>A. Some people may experience side effects, which are a part of the normal immune response to a vaccine. The majority of the side effects, while not seen in every individual, are signs that your body is recognizing the vaccine and mounting an immune response. Based on prior studies, side effects may include pain, redness and swelling at the site of the injection., fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, fever, nausea, malaise, and swollen lymph nodes. These symptoms may occur within 2 days after the shot and last 1 to 2 days. Side effects may be more frequent after the 2nd shot (booster) and less frequent among older adults\nLong-term side effects are unknown, although most vaccines do not have long-term side effects. Vaccine studies are ongoing and will continue to monitor and watch for adverse events.</td>

      <td>A. Many things helped this vaccine get developed so rapidly. Significant resources were invested to fund the basic research and clinical trials, accelerating timelines greatly. Joining existing trial sites instead of developing new sites was a time saver. The virus has a good vaccination target and relatively low mutation rate. Additionally, the amount of infection in the communities allowed scientists to quickly compare vaccinated to unvaccinated populations and conclusively shows the vaccine worked. Last, but not least, are the huge number of brave volunteers willing to try the “novel” vaccines during the clinical trials.</td>

      <td>A. The vaccine manufacturers, CDC, and the state are all committed to getting the vaccine to everyone as soon as possible. ACIP is a group of medical and public health experts that develop recommendations on how to use vaccines to control diseases in the U.S. ACIP decides on vaccine prioritization recommendations by reviewing the FDA information, clinical trial data, and other information. Initially, the limited supply of vaccine will only be available to those determined to be most at risk of exposure to COVID-19. As the vaccine supply increases, more people will be added to those prioritized until it is available to the adult population at large.</td>

Instead of mRNA, the one-dose vaccine (made by Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen) uses DNA to give your body the same type of temporary instructions. The DNA is carried into the body on a harmless virus called adenovirus. All the vaccines are very effective in preventing someone from getting COVID-19 and preventing hospitalization and death. The clinical trial showed no serious safety concerns. Your body naturally breaks down everything in the vaccine. There is no COVID-19 virus in the vaccine, and none of the vaccines can change your DNA.\nPeople who receive the one-dose vaccine do not need to return for a second vaccination. The temporary reactions are similar among all vaccines, although people receiving the one-dose vaccine may only experience temporary reactions once. Temporary reactions may include a sore arm, headache, fever and feeling tired and achy for a day or two after receiving the vaccine. Younger people are more likely to have reactions than older people. None of the vaccines can give you COVID-19.</td>

The second dose “boosts” the immune response to be fully protected. The second shot will come about 3-4 weeks after the first. It is important to get two doses of the same vaccine.\nWhile other countries may take a different approach to vaccinations, the FDA and CDC continue to recommend that everyone get two-shots.

      <td>The best information on the side effects of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines comes from the large phase 3 trials that served as the basis for the Emergency Use Authorizations. The most common side effects of both vaccines are what is called reactogenicity. These are expected side effects and caused by local inflammation (redness and swelling) at the site of injection or more generalized reactions such as fever and muscle aches. For both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, these reactogenic side effects were mild to moderate, occurred up to two days after vaccination, and do not have any long-term consequences. For the Pfizer mRNA vaccine, the most common side effects were soreness or redness at the site of injection (84% of vaccine recipients), fatigue (63%), headache (55%), muscle pain (38%), chills (32%), joint pain (24%), and fever (14%). Side effects following receipt of the Moderna mRNA vaccine were similar but with slightly different frequencies. The most common side effects were soreness or redness at the site of injection (92%), fatigue (69%), headache (63%), muscle pain (60%), joint pain (45%), and chills (43%).\nMore severe allergic reactions have occurred more rarely in some people immediately following receipt of one of the mRNA vaccines. In a recent analysis conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 10 cases of anaphylaxis were reported after administration of 4,041,396 first doses of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine between December 21, 2020 and January 10, 2021. This was an incidence of 2.5 cases of severe allergic reactions per one million doses administered. For this reason, the mRNA vaccines should only be administered in a setting capable of managing and treating anaphylactic reactions. We still do not know the exact cause of these reactions but some think it may be a reaction to the fatty coat that surrounds and protects the mRNA in the vaccine, specifically polyethylene glycol, a compound found in many products including skin creams and toothpaste and that has been associated with allergic reactions. People who have an immediate allergic reaction to the first vaccine dose should not receive additional doses of either mRNA Covid-19 vaccine.</td>

For this reason, the second Covid-19 vaccine dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible. However, current challenges with vaccine availability may make this not possible. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines may be administered up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose when it is not possible to adhere to the standard schedule but notes that there are limited data on the efficacy of mRNA vaccines administered beyond this time.</td>

The vaccine is not 100% effective and we still do not know if someone who was vaccinated can develop asymptomatic infection and transmit the virus. Although the phase 3 clinical trials were designed to determine whether vaccinated individuals are protected against disease, it will also be important to understand whether vaccinated individuals are less likely to transmit the virus. This is likely but not ensured. If a vaccine not only protects against disease but reduces transmission, and continues to do so for many years, we are likely to reach a state of herd protection when masks and physical distancing will no longer be required. Herd protection is achieved when a sufficient proportion of the population is made non-infectious through vaccination or natural infection so that the likelihood of an infectious individual transmitting to a susceptible individual is very low.</td>

On December 11, 2020 the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid‐19 Vaccine and on December 18, 2020 the FDA issued an EUA for the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine. We expect that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines will receive full approval, called a Biologics License Application, in the first half of 2021.\nThe bar for ensuring safety of a vaccine is higher than for a therapeutic to treat an ill person.

      <td>Traditionally, it has taken many years to develop a vaccine, confirm its safety and efficacy, and manufacture the vaccine in sufficient quantities for public use. This timeline has been substantially shortened for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. There are several ways this has been made possible. First, some clinical trials have combined phases 1 and 2 to assess safety and immune responses. Second, because of the high number of new cases of Covid-19 in many places, differences in disease risk between those who received the viral vaccine and those who received the placebo or comparison vaccine can be measured more quickly than in the absence of a pandemic. Third, the United States government and others heavily invested in building the manufacturing capacity to produce large numbers of vaccine doses before the findings of the phase 3 trials were available. Typically, vaccine manufacturers wait until the phase 3 trial is completed and shows safety and efficacy before making such a large investment in manufacturing capacity. None of these factors that contribute to the accelerated development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 imply that safety, scientific or ethical integrity are compromised, or that short-cuts were made.</td>

The development of several vaccines would allow the vaccine to be safe and effective in people of all ages, demographics and underlying medical conditions. For example, some vaccines, such as the vaccine for chickenpox, cannot be given to people with certain types of medical conditions (pregnant women or people whose immune system does not function well due to underlying medical problems).

However, it is important to think about vaccines as a tool in a toolbox against the spread of COVID-19 infection.

      <td>It’s true that normally this process can take years, sometimes decades, from start to finish to develop a vaccine. One reason that pace for a COVID-19 vaccine has taken off so quickly is that there is funding for vaccine development on a global scale. The entire world is looking for an effective vaccine; these are unprecedented times and everyone is rolling up their sleeves. Several of the vaccines farthest along in clinical testing are those that that have a vaccine backbone (or platform) previously developed against other viruses (Ebola) as well other Coronaviruses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). In this way a lot of the early work – especially the preclinical work – has already been done, and many of these similar vaccines have been well studied in human volunteers. In addition, these vaccines are being given top priority over almost all other products in the pipeline; this saves a lot of time.</td>

In preparation for the return of faculty, staff and students to campus, HVAC systems are receiving regular maintenance, including filter changes and treatment for prevention of Legionella. There are three main types of buildings (in terms of air handling) among our academic, administrative, and residential buildings on campus. The first type of building is capable of providing exclusively outside air to the air handling system, and these buildings have been set to do just that. The second type has systems that can be set to have the majority of air provided from the outside, but do need a certain minimum amount of return air in order to properly operate. These buildings have been tuned to maximize, to the greatest extent possible, outside air supply. The third type of buildings do not use centralized air handling systems, and get fresh air from opening widows, much like a residence.\nFor buildings with building-wide HVAC systems, all supply air into the buildings, whether 100% fresh air or fresh air mixed with return air from the building, passes through a filtration system with at least a Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) of 12. The filters have an 80% -90% particle size efficiency in capturing particles between 1.0 – 3.0 microns and a 90% or greater efficiency in capturing particles 3.0 – 10.0 microns in size.</td>

Researchers took DNA from the coronavirus and put it in a shell called an adenovirus. The adenovirus cannot replicate in your system or make you sick. It acts as a Trojan horse by entering your system like a virus would and then prompting your body to create antibodies. Johnson &amp; Johnson has decades of research on adenovirus vaccines. Other vaccines available that use this technology include the Ebola vaccine (also made by Johnson &amp; Johnson), the HPV vaccine, the hepatitis B vaccine and even one of the influenza vaccines.\nUnlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, only one dose is required for the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines must be stored in freezers, while the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine can be kept in a refrigerator for at least three months.</td>

The vaccine CANNOT cause a COVID-19 infection but can cause side effects, including pain at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain and fever. Pfizer has reported that some Phase III clinical trial participants experienced mild to moderate flu-like side effects, including sore arm, muscle aches and fever.\nUltimately, symptoms such as sore arms, muscle aches, fever and headaches mean that your immune system is responding to the vaccine and producing antibodies that will protect against future infection with coronavirus.

The administrative portions of the trial have been sped up. The scientific analysis of clinical trial participants remains the same for these and all other vaccines. If there’s evidence that strongly suggests that patients have benefited from the vaccine in clinical trials and that it is safe, the agency can issue an EUA to make it available. The FDA has issued EUAs many times previously in other situations. The EUA process is well established and is not newly created to address COVID-19 vaccine development.

      <td>When will a vaccine be available for children? What about children with cancer?</td>
      <td>Because children’s immune systems are different from those of adults, pediatric clinical trials are essential to establish safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines among children. As some pediatric trials are just getting started, it will be some time before we see a vaccine available for kids – likely later into 2021. While we don’t know when trials will begin that include children with cancer, it’s a good idea to begin discussing vaccination plans with your child’s oncologist. LLS continues to monitor for developments closely. We are keeping abreast of the ongoing studies, and advocating for the inclusion of cancer patients and survivors in clinical trials when it is safe to do so.</td>

      <td>Will COVID-19 vaccines be safe for blood cancer patients? Should I get one right away?</td>
      <td>Both vaccines were shown to be safe in clinical trials and more than 31 million Americans have received at least one vaccine dose so far. At this time, patients undergoing cancer treatment may be offered vaccination against COVID-19 if they have no other contraindications to these vaccines. Data keeps coming in about how dangerous the virus is for cancer patients—particularly those with blood cancer, so vaccination will be very important.</td>

      <td>Have blood cancer patients been included in clinical trials studying the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines?</td>
      <td>Cancer patients were generally not included in many of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. While there is no reason to believe vaccine safety will be different in cancer patients, important questions remain about how well these vaccines induce immunity in patients with cancer, particularly those undergoing treatment. Specifically, some cancer patients may not be able to develop a full immune response due to their cancer or cancer treatment so they may still contract the virus and spread it to others. That’s why it’s important for cancer patients to continue to take other preventative measures like hand washing, wearing masks and social distancing.</td>

      <td>I have experienced severe allergic reactions to prior vaccines or injectable drugs. Can I still get the COVID-19 vaccine?</td>
      <td>Currently, CDC considers a history of severe allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, to any vaccine or to any injectable therapy (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous, or subcutaneous) as a precaution, but not contraindication, to vaccination. However, severe allergic to any specific component of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines is a contraindication to vaccination.</td>

      <td>Does COVID-19 produce different symptoms in cancer patients than in other people?</td>
      <td>Overall, the symptoms of COVID-19 are the same in cancer patients as the general population. One exception might be patients who are taking steroids or other medications to treat leukemia or lymphoma. These treatments can suppress the development of fevers. As a result, patients with COVID-19 who are taking these types of medications may not register a fever — or as high a fever — as others with the infection.</td>
